  <img src="images/pathfinder2.jpg">
  <p>This game is the sequel to Pathfinder Kingmaker set 100 years or so after the events of that game. In this game you are in the realm of Sarkois which was destroyed when Areelu Vorlesh, a scholar and practitioner of forbidden magics, opened a rift to the abyssal plaes of existence, and let in hordes of demons that then invaded the world of Golarion. They are led by the evil Demon Lords of Baphomet and Deskari. The abyssal forces crushed all who stood against them and had turned Sarkois into a demon-infested land that is now called the Worldwound. You will join the Crusade against the demonic invasions and will rise as a new hero wielding unimaginable powers in this classic CRPG. The fate of this world lies in your hands.</p>
