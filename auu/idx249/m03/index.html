   <p>I have many different interests and things that make me happy and relaxed in life. I listed the top 3 that I am currently been invested into. Drawing character illustrations for tabletop roleplay games, and just characters in general. A book series known as the Court series by Sarah J, Maas. I am currently on book 3 of this series and have found it quite enjoyable. I have also included video games as I am an avid gamer and have always found enjoyment from games.</p>
