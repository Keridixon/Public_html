<p>I am a Character Illustrator. I love designing characters for DnD, Vampire the Masquerade and many other tabletop rpgs. I have always had a passion for it. I mostly use my days for video games, character designs, or drawing other things as well as reading. They are relaxing to me and something I quite enjoy. I have had a passion for art I discovered back in high school years ago. It is something I have come through many trials to get through. Once I complete my Bachelors degree this term after 2 other schools closing down, I will be pursuing my Master's of Fine Arts in Visual Development so that I can make a career out of character designs.</p> 

<p>Coding and web design give me a unique opportunity to express my creativity and problem-solving abilities, which is why I'm so passionate about them. Coding resembles a huge material where I can change my thoughts into substantial, utilitarian elements. Making sites permits me to combine my creative vision with specialized capability as I shape the computerized scene into easy to use and outwardly engaging connection points. The unique idea of coding and website composition consistently provokes me to keep up to date with mechanical progressions, encouraging a steady expectation to learn and adapt that I view as both thrilling and fulfilling. Besides, the capacity to rejuvenate my ideas on the web, where they can influence a worldwide crowd, is a strong inspiration for me. Coding and website architecture address specialized abilities as well as a door to development, articulation, and the boundless potential outcomes of the computerized domain.</p>
